                <p>The first seeds of <em>Heroes del Silencio</em> were planted in the group <em>Zumo de Vidrio</em>, formed by
                    guitarist Juan Valdiva with family members. Enrique Bunbury later became its bassist. When
                    Valdiva heard Bunbury sing a David Bowie cover, however, he moved him into the lead vocal
                    spot and changed their name to <em>Heroes del Silencio</em> in 1985. The new lineup included bassist
                    Joaquin Cardiel and drummer Pedro Andreu. With Bunbury and Valdiva writing the songs, they
                <img src="images/Mar.jpg" alt="Heroes begginings">
                    gelled quickly, cutting demos that amounted to little but quickly establishing themselves
                    as a high-energy live act with an unusual sound. Word of mouth ensured they were selling
                    out most shows by late 1986. In 1987 they took second place in a battle of the bands in
                    Salamanca. Ole Ole member and EMI producer/A&amp;R man Gustavo Montesano was in the
                    audience. Impressed, he caught another show a few weeks later and, convinced of his original
                    impressions, signed them to the label.
                </p>
                <p>In late 1987, <em>Heroes del Silencio</em> issued their debut EP, <b>HÃ©roe de Leyenda</b>; it sold more than
                    320,000 copies due to the band's burgeoning live reputation. They followed by playing dozens
                    of shows across Spain. Their full-length debut, 1988's <b>El Mar No Cesa</b>, was co-produced by
                    Montesano and Roberto Durruty. The set was greeted with enthusiasm when radio picked up the
                    single "Mar Adentro." The album was certified platinum within a week of its release. The band
                    were delighted but slightly concerned as the album offered a softer, more pop-oriented sound
                    than their live shows did. To that end, they released the live outing En Directo in 1989.

            <div id="rise">
                <h2>THE INTERNATIONAL RISE</h2>
                <p>The band enlisted fan and Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera to produce their second long-player,
                    1990's Senderos de Traicion. Recording in London, he brought out their post-punk roots, highlighting
                    the interplay between Valdiva's increasingly inventive guitar playing that drew on Celtic, Gothic,
                    and flamenco root sources, driving hard rock rhythms, and Bunbury's forceful presence as both
                    singer and lyricist. The set topped the Spanish charts and was certified triple platinum. In

                    Germany it peaked inside the Top 20 and went platinum, and registered another platinum
                    certification in Switzerland where it reached inside the Top 40. The support tour took
                    <em>Heroes del Silencio</em> to North America. While playing in Mexico, they met future rhythm guitarist
                    Alan Boguslavsky. The band also sold out concerts in various European countries including Germany
                    (where their appearance at a Rock Against Racism benefit concert won them a legion of new fans)
                    and Belgium. A subsequent live document entitled Senda 91' resulted from this tour.

                <h2>ROCKSTARS</h2>
                <p><em>Heroes del Silencio</em> stuck with Manzanera as producer for 1993's double-length El Espiritu del Vino.
                    It netted five charting singles, including two number ones in "Nuestros Nombres" and "La Herida." The
                    album topped the chart in Spain and landed inside the Top Ten in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland on
                <img src="images/heroes.jpg" alt="Heroes cover ">
                    its way to multi-platinum certification. Naming their support tour El Camino del Exceso, the band hired
                    Boguslavsky as a touring (and then permanent) rhythm guitarist and sold out shows in Germany, Austria,
                    Portugal, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, U.S.A, Chile, Finland, and Hungary.

                <h2>THE CONFLICTS ARISE</h2>
                <p><em>Heroes del Silencio's</em> constant cycle of activity over the previous six years had taken its toll on
                    individual members. Pressures mounted and tensions between Bunbury and Valdiva emerged. External events
                    such as the deaths of their road manager Martin Druille in 1993 and Bunbury's brother, Rafael, in 1994
                    contributed to the pressure.

            <div id="split">
                <h2>THE SPLIT</h2>
                <p >Collective exhaustion took its toll and conflicts between members became more frequent and personal. During
                    the tour, Bunbury wrote songs for a solo album. Shortly before the tour's conclusion, the band held a press
                <img src="images/Avalancha!.jpg" alt="Heroes live">
                    conference and announced a temporary split. It was much more than that; Bunbury and Valdiva were barely
                    speaking to one another. After the announcement, a final show in Los Angeles was canceled. The double-live
                    LP Para Siempre was released, drawn from two 1993 concerts in Spain.
                </p>
                <p >In 1997, Bunbury issued his solo debut, Radical Sonora, with Chrysalis. The following year, Rarezas, a
                    collection of rare and unreleased tracks, was issued by EMI under protest from virtually all the members
                    of <em>Heroes del Silencio</em>. In 2005, the audio/video package El Ruido y la Furia was released, documenting a
                    1993 concert in Madrid. It topped the Spanish album charts and was followed by the 2006 retrospective
                    multi-CD/DVD package <em>Heroes del Silencio: The Platinum Collection</em>.

                <h2>ONE LAST GOODBYE</h2>
                <p>Buoyed by the continued success of their catalog and the sales of the previous year's live album, <em>Heroes
                    del Silencio</em> reunited in 2007 for a ten-date stadium tour, playing Guatemala City, Buenos Aires, Monterrey,
                    Mexico City, Los Angeles, Sevilla, Zaragoza, and Valencia, with Valdiva's brother Gonzalo as rhythm guitarist.

                    They sold out every venue -- the smallest had 20,000 seats. Upon their return, they issued Tour 2007 as a
                    deluxe package containing two CDs and two DVDs along with other tour memorabilia. It peaked at three in
                    Spain but went to number one in Mexico. In 2011, EMI issued the audio/video package Live in Germany, which
                    included selections performed on their 1993 tour. In 2021, Netflix acquired Alexis Morante's documentary
                    film <em>Heroes: Silencio y Rock and Roll</em> that charted the rise of <em>Heroes del Silencio</em>
                    with participation from
                    all four original members. WEA Spain released a 30-cut soundtrack of the same title.
