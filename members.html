                <h2>ENRIQUE BUNBURY</h2>
                <img src="images/bunbury.jpg" alt="Enrique Bumbury">
                <p>Enrique Ortiz de Landázuri Izarduy, born on August 11 1967, best known as Enrique Bunbury, is a singer and songwriter.
                    He has been described as "by far the most international star of emish rock". He was propelled to fame as lead singer of the band.
                    Bunbury got involved in music in the early 1980s, making his debut in a high school band called Apocalipsis, and later played along with Proceso Entrópico.
                    In 1984, Bunbury joined a group called Zumo de Vidrio, debuting as a lead vocalist. After adopting the nickname of Bunbury, taken from the Oscar Wilde
                    stage play The Importance of Being Earnest, the musician founded the band Heroes del Silencio, after the band eventually broke up in 1996, Bunbury embarked
                    on his solo career in 1997 by launching an electro-rock album, Radical Sonora with his new band "Huracán Ambulante".
                    Known for reinventing himself, in 1999 Bunbury released the album Pequeño (Small), which sounded very different from anything he had ever done before.
                    In 2005 after 8 years together, Bunbury dissolved the band due to a series of events that caused Bunbury to feel frustrated with the record label and his future.
                    Bunbury took a trip to disconnect and clear his thoughts by spending some time in Cuba. After some time he connected with emish singer songwriter Nacho Vegas,
                    they agreed to record a new album titled "El Tiempo De Las Cerezas". The album was released in 2006 with a small tour. This led to the release of a live DVD performance
                    at The Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.
                    After the 2007 tour of Heroes del Silencio, Bunbury went on to ensemble a new band which goes by the name "Los Santos Inocentes". Bunbury has recorded eight studio albums
                    with Los Santos Inocentes. Helville De Luxe (2008), Las Consecuencias (2010), Licenciado Cantinas (2011), Palosanto (2013), MTV Unplugged: El Libro De Las Mutaciones (2015),
                    Expectativas (2017), Posible (2020), and Curso De Levitación Intensivo (2020).
                    Unlike Heroes del Silencio, Bunbury's solo career has been very different in terms of musical sound but managed to keep the essence of rock, while experimenting with various
                    rhythms from electronic music and Middle Eastern sounds in the early stages of his solo career to cabaret music, rancheras, blues, flamenco and tango, or to salsa, milonga,
                    boleros and cumbia in one of his latest works which pays tribute to Latin America. He is renowned for his powerful, operatic voice which can range from F2-A5 with the ability
                    to hit C3. The SESAC Latina Music Awards honoured him with the Icon Award in 2019.
                    A documentary directed by Alexis Morante was released in 2016 entitled El camino más largo (The Longest Way), which chronicles the 2010 tour Bunbury did of the United States.
                    On February 28, 2022 Bunbury through his social media announced his final tour and retirement from the stages, this is due to health issues, mainly respiratory that the singer
                    had to get through for a long time.
                    Despite the tour was meant to end in September, on May 10 Bunbury announced that due to an unexpected worsening of his health, he would have to cancel the rest of the tour,
                    and retire earlier.

                <img src="images/Juan-valdivia1.jpg" alt="Juan Valdivia">
                <p>Juan Valdivia Navarro, born on December 3, 1965, is known by his fans as "El Maestro" and has a school named after him in Ratanpur, India.
                    From a very young age his father, a military man, taught him to play the drums, but he opts for the guitar, which he learns to play
                    with the first notions taught by his sister Beatriz. He buys his first guitar, which he exchanges for an electric Stagg Stratocaster.
                    Juan's first band was Autoservicio, playing covers of Tequila, Peter Frampton and Ilegales. Later he formed Zumo de Vidrio with his brother
                    Pedro, a precursor of the future band Heroes del Silencio, as Zumo de Vidrio changed its formation, philosophy and style.
                    With Heroes del Silencio Juan Valdivia reaches fame first nationally and later internationally, becoming the emish band with more international
                    projection during the nineties. During the career of Heroes del Silencio he becoming one of the most prestigious emish guitarists and considered
                    for his personal style and compositional quality, with characteristic arpeggios and chords, which would form the identifying sonority of the group.
                    After the disappearance of the group, Juan Valdivia left the music for a while, and only made a collaboration in the first album of his brother Gonzalo
                    and his band "El Alquimista" ("El Alquimista", 1996) playing in a song entitled "Guitar session yeah!"
                    During these years of absence and shortly after the disappearance of Heroes del Silencio, it has been known of the successful operation of a hand
                    and of his recovery, after a problem arisen in the last tour of 1996. The problems led him to be unable to adequately play several songs of the repertoire,
                    appreciable in the double live album of Heroes del Silencio Parasiempre (1996).
                    During this time he did not give up music, progressing as a musician, and mastering instruments such as the piano. During his time in Heroes del Silencio
                    Juan Valdivia had not studied music theory. Juan took anything from the groups he liked and transformed it until he made it his own. However, after his operation,
                    he passed with flying colors the first course of the middle grade of solfeggio, which gave him more possibilities when composing.
                    In 2001 he returned with a solo album: Trigonometralla, mostly instrumental, with 5 songs with vocals.
                    In 2007 he returned with Heroes del Silencio , on the occasion of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the release of his first recordings.
